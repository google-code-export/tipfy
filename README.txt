Tipfy is a small but powerful framework designed specifically for Google
App Engine. It is a lot like webapp::

  from tipfy import RequestHandler, Response

  class HelloWorldHandler(RequestHandler):
      def get(self):
          return Response('Hello, World!')


...but offers a lot of features (own authentication, sessions,
internationalization etc) and other goodies that webapp misses. Everything in a
modular, lightweight way, tuned for App Engine. You use only what you need,
when you need.
