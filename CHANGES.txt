Version 0.5 - Codename "Spiff"
==============================
- Added a middleware system for handlers: handlers can now hook pre and post
  dispatch routines in the handler class itself. Very useful to make base
  handlers with similar requirements and characteristics, without adding
  overhead to non-related, simpler handlers. A few initial middleware classes
  were added:

  - I18nMiddleware
  - SessionMiddleware
  - UserMiddleware

  This deprecates several functionalities performed by app hooks before.
  While hooks are still useful to wrap and extend WSGIApplication, middleware
  applied directly to handlers are more appropriate in several use cases.

  Thanks to Thomas Johansson (prencher) for the invaluable feedback on this.

- Added handler mixin classes to handle blobstore upload and serving, and
  several others. Each of them add a couple of attributes or methods to a
  request handler:

  - AclMixin
  - BlobstoreDownloadMixin
  - BlobstoreUploadMixin
  - Jinja2Mixin
  - MakoMixin
  - MessagesMixin
  - SessionMixin

- Added some new db.Model properties to tipfy.ext.db:

  - JsonProperty
  - TimezoneProperty (thanks to Thomas Johansson)

- Added post_make_app application hook.

- tipfy.ext.session was rewritten from scratch. It now works as a provider of
  sessions and related stuff, such as signed flash messages and secure cookies.

- tipfy.ext.messages was removed and all the existing functionality was merged
  intoto tipfy.ext.session.

- tipfy.ext.user was renamed to tipfy.ext.auth.

- tipfy.ext.i18n doesn't require initialization anymore; it is initialized when
  first used. Locale for the current request can be automatically loaded using
  several configurable methods (taking arguments from GET, POST, cookies or
  URL parameters).

- Several improvements everywhere, and a lot more documentation and unit test
  coverage.
