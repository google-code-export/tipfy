Version 0.6.1 - July 10, 2010
=============================
- Bug fix release. Session middleware was broken for app-wide sessions. Irony
  is that this was the only piece of code not tested...


Version 0.6 - July 10, 2010
===========================
- This is a major refactoring to better support new session backends:
  - New backends can be easly registered with the session store.
  - Multiple backends can now be used *at the same time*.

- Added memcache-only backend, so now the built-in backends are datastore,
  memcache and secure cookie.

- Added or split several mixins. The complete list of mixins and the methods
  or attributes they provide is:
  - CookieMixin: set_cookie(), delete_cookie()
  - SecureCookieMixin: get_secure_cookie()
  - FlashMixin: get_flash(), set_flash()
  - MessagesMixin: messages, set_message()
  - SessionMixin: session, get_session()
  - AllSessionMixins: combine all the previous mixins

  All mixins also have the attribute 'session_store', to access the underlying
  session provider.

- Session store is now registered in the request registry, as tipfy moves away
  from using thread locals.


Version 0.5.5 - June 1st, 2010
==============================
- Fixed namespace warnings.


Version 0.5.4 - May 31, 2010
============================
- Initial release: moved from tipfy core to a separate extension.
