Hello, World! Tutorial
======================

.. _Tipfy: http://code.google.com/p/tipfy/

.. _Jinja2's documentation: http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/documentation/

This tutorial demonstrates the simplest Tipfy application.

All that is needed to create an application using Tipfy is a class to process
requests (the "request handler") and a rule to execute the request handler when
a certain aplication URL is accessed.

First, lets create the request handler. Define a ``HelloWorldHandler`` to
display a 'Hello, World!' message, like this:

**handlers.py**

.. code-block:: python

   from tipfy import RequestHandler, Response

   class HelloWorldHandler(RequestHandler):
       """The simplest Tipfy handler example."""
       def get(self, **kwargs):
           return Response('Hello, World!')


Here we extend the base class ``RequestHandler`` and add a method ``get`` to be
executed on ``GET`` requests. Then we return a ``Response`` object with our
Hello, World! message. The key points are:

- The handler method that is called corresponds to the current request method.
  In this case we will only handle ``GET`` requests, so we only defined
  ``get()`` in the handler. To handle ``POST`` requests, we would need to add a
  ``post()`` method, and so on.

- ``RequestHandler`` methods receive keyword arguments from the routing system.
  These are variables extracted from the current URL according to the rules
  you define. In this case, we won't receive any arguments, but this is worth
  noting anyway.

- The handler must always returns a ``werkzeug.Response`` object.

To execute our ``HelloWorldHandler``, we define a rule in ``urls.py`` (we are
also defining in advance the rules we will use in the next examples):

**urls.py**

.. code-block:: python

   from tipfy import Rule

   def get_rules():
       rules = [
           Rule('/', endpoint='hello/world', handler='handlers.HelloWorldHandler'),
           Rule('/hello-jinja', endpoint='hello/jinja', handler='handlers.HelloJinjaHandler'),
           Rule('/hello-json', endpoint='hello/json', handler='handlers.HelloJsonHandler'),
           Rule('/hello-ajax', endpoint='hello/ajax', handler='handlers.HelloAjaxHandler'),
       ]

       return rules


A list of ``tipfy.Rule`` is defined in this file and returned by
``get_rules()``. The key points are:

- The first parameter in each rule is the URL path: when accessing this path,
  Tipfy will execute the handler defined in the rule. The path can contain
  variables to be matched.

- The ``endpoint`` argument is a friendly name we can use later to build URL's.

- The ``handler`` argument defines which ``RequestHandler`` object will be
  executed when the defined path is accessed. In this case, we will execute
  ``HelloWorldHandler`` from ``handlers.py``, so it is set to
  ``hello.HelloWorldHandler``. The handler class is imported and cached to be
  reused in subsequent requests; that's why it it is set as a string.

For more information about the Request and Response objects and how to define
url rules, see `Werkzeug's documentation`_.


Hello, World!, take 2: A Template Odissey
-----------------------------------------
How about using templates? Let's remake our ``HelloWorldHandler`` to use a
Jinja2 template instead of setting a raw response. First, define a
``hello.html`` template in the ``/templates`` dir:

**templates/hello.html**

.. code-block:: html+django

   {{ message }}


This template only outputs a message variable, as you see. Now let's redefine
our ``HelloWorldHandler``:

**handlers.py**

.. code-block:: python

   from tipfy import RequestHandler
   from tipfy.ext.jinja2 import render_response

   class HelloJinjaHandler(RequestHandler):
       """A handler that outputs the result of a rendered template."""
       def get(self, **kwargs):
           return render_response('hello.html', message='Hello, Jinja!')


That's it. ``render_response()`` will render a Jinja2 template and fill a
response object, which is exactly what we need to return. You could also use
``tipfy.ext.mako`` if you prefer Mako templates, or create a new extension to
use your favorite template engine.

Most of the time when rendering a page we just return ``render_response()``,
passing the template name and a keyword arguments we want to use as
variables in the template. By convention, we call these keyword arguments
``context``.

For more information about Jinja2 syntax, check `Jinja2's documentation`_.


Hello, World!, take 3: JSON Christ Superstar
--------------------------------------------

We can also easily render a ``JSON`` response with some variables, as in this
example:

**handlers.py**

.. code-block:: python

   from tipfy import RequestHandler, render_json_response

   class HelloJsonHandler(RequestHandler):
       """A handler that outputs a JSON string."""
       def get(self, **kwargs):
           context = {'message': 'Hello, Json!'}
           return render_json_response(context)


This will output a ``application/json`` response with the context dictionary
encoded as ``JSON``.


Hello, World!, take 4: The AJAX Revenge
---------------------------------------
Another interesting thing we could do is to render a response conditionally to
the request. For example, render a template for normal requests or a ``JSON``
response for ``AJAX`` requests. Here's how we can achieve this:

**handlers.py**

.. code-block:: python

   class HelloAjaxHandler(RequestHandler):
       """A handler that sends a different output for requests using AJAX."""
       def get(self, **kwargs):
           context = {'message': 'Hello, Ajax!'}
           if request.is_xhr:
               return render_json_response(context)
           else:
               return render_response('hello.html', **context)


We just need to check the ``is_xhr`` variable in the request object, which is
``True`` when the request is made through ``XMLHttpRequest``, aka ``AJAX``.


That's it!

These are the very basics to run an app using Tipfy. There is a lot more
to explore. Go check other tutorials or the API documentation and have fun!
